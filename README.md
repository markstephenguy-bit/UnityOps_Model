Here’s a clean **root `README.md`** you can drop in so the GitHub landing page clearly explains **UnityOps\_Model**.

# UnityOps_Model

**UnityOps_Model** is the **context repository** for the UnityOps system.  
It is the single source of truth for *what* we are building and *why* — before any code, infrastructure, or DSL modeling.

---

## 📜 Purpose
- Capture the **vision**, **principles**, and **constraints** that guide UnityOps.
- Define **capabilities**, **personas**, and **use cases** in business terms.
- Establish **non-functional requirements** (NFRs) and **success metrics**.
- Maintain a **governance trail** through ADRs and readiness checklists.

This repo contains **no application code**. It exists to keep design and implementation aligned with the agreed business context.

## 📂 Structure
```

/context/                # Vision, principles, capabilities, use-cases, domain language
/context/use-cases/      # Business scenarios in Gherkin + acceptance criteria
/context/domain/         # Ubiquitous language and bounded contexts
/adr/                    # Architecture Decision Records
/schemas/                # JSON Schema for machine-validating context files
/.github/workflows/      # CI jobs for context validation

```

---

## 🚦 Workflow
1. **Draft Context** → Fill out `context/` files for a use case.
2. **Validate** → PR triggers CI to check file completeness + schema compliance.
3. **Review & Approve** → Merge when readiness checklist is ✅.
4. **Gate** → Only after a use case is “Context Ready” can model framework (DSL) work begin.

---

## ✅ Readiness Checklist (per use case)
- Vision & measurable outcomes defined
- Persona & scenarios written
- Capability marked as “approved”
- Principles & constraints reviewed
- NFRs & risks documented
- ADR(s) added if needed

See [`context/readiness-checklist.md`](context/readiness-checklist.md) for details.

Do you want me to also add a **short “About” description** for the GitHub sidebar so it shows up next to the repo name? That way people see the purpose even without opening the README.
